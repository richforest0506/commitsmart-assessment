# Front-end Assessment

## Task description: 

Implementation of an information interface for tourists. Where you find information about the planned destination. Use any 3rd party framework, template, or anything that speeds up development and is ultimately useful. (Responsive design is an advantage, but do not focus on this, it is enough if we can check the functions on the desktop)

(Example) https://tripscout.co/

## Requirements:


•	2 -language content (enough to write content in 1 language but have 2 Translate files that the user can change)
•	The list elements (location, descriptions of locations, pictures of locations, ratings… etc.) should be returned to the feed by a fake response. Prepared for a real synchronous or asynchronous API communication.
•	Search box: It should search in the full list based on the 1-1 text parameter of the location
•	Making an Infinite scroll for the feed.
